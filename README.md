# Python-Stk-Public
A collection of models to do quantitative analysis on the stock market.

This project uses Keras as an interface for Tensorflow-GPU. The models are trained and tested on my PC's GPU.
All packages are installed using Anaconda and the Conda package manager.

Currently I'm working on another ensemble for options analysis, as well as a transformer to do sentiment analysis on company descriptions.
